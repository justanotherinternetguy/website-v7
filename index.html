              This is my own little website and blog that I manage. I started
              maintaining my own website in 2020. I have gone through countless
              overhauls, so don't be alarmed if my website completely changes
              one day.

                I was born and spent my early years in Shanghai before moving to
                the United States. I consider myself

                both Mandarin and English fluently.

                  I support technological progression and research - I believe
                  that modern technology has made our lives better, although
                  modern usage and application of technology has become an
                  issue. Tech is too much focused on profit and violates human
                  rights to privacy while trying to make a larger profit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In a similar vein, I also support the GNU/FOSS movements and
                  advocate for freedom information and consumer privacy on the
                  internet.
